            <h2>About the Assignment</h2>
            <p>As part of your Digital Desigmn class, you will design a website that looks similar to this example. You'll be using Chat GPT to learn how to design a website from scratch, just as I did. If your teacher, who has no prior experience in teaching Computer Science until this year, can figure it out in less than 20 minutes, you can certainly figure it out too! </p>
            <p>In addition to learning how to design a website, you'll also learn how to modify the HTML code to add the content and structure you want, and the CSS code to style it according to your preferences. You'll have all of this week to work on your website in class and deisgn it exactly the way you want.</p>
            <p>You'll need to create a personal portfolio to showcase your skills, projects, and achievements. You can include sections like an about me, resume, portfolio gallery, and more. This portfolio does not have to be limited to Computer Tech; you can showcase any skills or accomplishments you want.</p>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>To get started, there are 2 different sets of instructions that you can follow:</p>
            <h3>First Set</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Figure out how to do the entire thing on your own by asking Chat GPT to guide you. </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Second Set</h3>
            <ol>
				<li>Open the pre-installed text editor, Notepad, on your computer.</li>
				<li>Create a new file and save it with the extension .html.</li>
				<li>Type the basic structure of an HTML document, including the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags.</li>
				<li>Or use Chat GPT to create the HTML code for your website. Start by giving prompts about using HTML to make a website about the career you've chosen. the layout and structure of your website.</li>
				<li>To change the structure and style of your website, you need to add CSS code. You can also use Chat GPT to create the CSS code or write it on your own.</li>
                <li>To input the CSS code Chat GPT gives you, you'll need to create a new file and save it with the extension .css.</li>
                <li>Ask Chat GPT how to apply your CSS code to your HTML code so that the structure and style changes appear</li>
				<li>Save your HTML and CSS files and go find where you saved the HTML file, then open with Google Chrome to see your website in action!</li>
                <lI>Whenever you make changes to the content of your website resave the HTML file, and whenver you make changes to the structure and style of your website, resave the CSS file. Then refresh your webpage to reflect those changes.</lI>
                <Li>When you are ready to publish your website and attach it to the assignment to be graded, ask Chat GPT how to publish your website using a free web hosting service. I personally believe the easiest one to use is GitHub Pages, which I used to create this one. I can help you more with this when you get to that point.</Li>
			</ol>
