            <h2>About the Assignment</h2>
            <p>As part of your Computer Tech class, you will create a website that looks similar to this example. You'll be using Chat GPT again to learn how to make a website from scratch, just as I did. If your teacher, who has no prior experience in teaching Computer Science until this year, can figure it out in less than 10 minutes, you can certainly figure out how to do it with the rest of the time you have left in class this week! In addition to learning how to create a website, you'll also learn how to modify the HTML code to add the content you want on your website, and the CSS code to structure and style your website according to your preferences. You'll have the entire week to work on your website in class and make it look exactly how you want it to.The website should be about the career path you aspire to pursue after completing high school and the steps you must take to make that career a reality.</p>

            <p>To get started, there are 2 different sets of instructions that you can follow:</p>
            <h3>First Set</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Figure out how to do the entire thing on your own by asking Chat GPT to guide you (like Mr. Ward did) </li>
            </ol>

				<li>Or use Chat GPT to create the HTML code for your website. Start by giving prompts about using HTML to make a website about the career you've chosen. the layout and structure of your website.</li>
				<li>To change the structure and style of your website, you need to add CSS code. You can also use Chat GPT to create the CSS code or write it on your own.</li>
                <li>To input the CSS code Chat GPT gives you, you'll need to create a new file and save it with the extension .css.</li>
                <li>Ask Chat GPT how to apply your CSS code to your HTML code so that the structure and style changes appear</li>
				<li>Save your HTML and CSS files and go find where you saved the HTML file, then open with Google Chrome to see your website in action!</li>
                <lI>Whenever you make changes to the content of your website resave the HTML file, and whenver you make changes to the structure and style of your website, resave the CSS file. Then refresh your webpage to reflect those changes.</lI>
                <Li>When you are ready to publish your website and attach it to the assignment to be graded, google 000webhost and figure out or ask Chat GPT how to publish your website using this free web hosting service.</Li>
